# KidMon System

## Project Overview

This project aims to address the issue of school payments. Nowadays, children are more vulnerable to being exposed to several dangerous things such as smoke and drugs. It is crucial to prevent this exposure at a young age, as children often try things without fully understanding the risks involved. Additionally, children with severe allergies must be cautious about the food they purchase. However, sometimes children try new things without knowing the ingredients, which can result in dangerous situations. Therefore, our KidMon system focuses on these core issues. We specifically target school cafeteria payments, aiming to raise parents' awareness and implement limitations. With our system, parents can transfer points to their child and set spending limits to prevent them from purchasing products that could trigger their allergies.
