# KidMon System

## Project Overview

This project aims at schools payments, Now a day kids are more vernuable to being exposed to serveral dangrus stuff like smoke and drugs,
preventing this from happening in a small age is important as kids tend to try stuff without understanding the risks,
Furthermore kids with severe allergies must be careful to the food there buying, but sometimes kids trys new stuff without know there ingredients resulting
in a dangerous situation.
So our KidMon system is focusing on these core issues, we are targeting school caffeterias payments with parents awarnes and limiting,
A parent can transfer points to his child, limit there spending , preventing them from buying products with there allergies
